# Core Dependencies
torch>=2.0.0
torchaudio>=2.0.0
numpy
scipy

# Transformer/LM Dependencies
transformers
accelerate
tokenizers

# Audio Codec Dependencies (EnCodec/SoundStream)
# We will use the implementation from torchaudio or a dedicated library
# For now, we'll assume torchaudio is sufficient for basic audio processing

# DDSP Dependencies
# DDSP is primarily implemented using PyTorch, but we might need specific
# libraries for differentiable DSP components if not implementing from scratch.
# For now, we assume core PyTorch is sufficient.
