# Boutique Guitar Sounds Research

## Phase 1: Tonewood Acoustic Properties

### How Wood Affects Acoustic Guitar Tone

The entire acoustic guitar is involved in the sound that emanates from it. When you pluck a string, sound energy transfers to the guitar's neck and body via the bridge and nut. From there, the soundwaves contact the wooden surfaces within the guitar's body. The audible tone depends on the type of wood used, which varies based on species of tree, growing location, and conditions. These factors lead to differences in wood density, which dramatically affects tone.

### Back & Side Tonewoods

The backs and sides have a strong influence on a guitar's projection and tone. Denser, harder woods create more sustain and sharper tones, while lighter woods produce softer tones and less sustain.

#### Rosewood Family

| Wood Type | Density | Tonal Characteristics | Appearance |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Brazilian Rosewood** | Very High | Complex tone, rich overtones, long sustain, deep resonance, beautiful balance of bass and treble | Dark brown with fine black lines and hints of orange, luxurious exotic look |
| **East Indian Rosewood** | High | Deep bass with rich overtones, simpler tonal profile | Dark brown to red and purple, simpler grain pattern |
| **Cocobolo** | Very High | Reflective, bright tone, accentuated treble response | Exotic appearance, highly figured |

#### Other Premium Back/Side Woods

| Wood Type | Density | Tonal Characteristics | Appearance |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Genuine Mahogany** | Medium | Loud sound, bright treble, punchy mid-range, less overwhelming bass | Lighter brown |
| **Sapele** | Medium | Powerful midrange, great punch, bright and airy trebles | Light/dark color banding |
| **Maple** | High | More sustain, focused bright sound, less complex overtones | Stunning figured grain, light color, sometimes flamed |
| **Koa** | Medium-High | Midrange projection, rounded smoother spectrum, increased sustain, enhanced top end | Vibrant red and brown shades |
| **Walnut** | High | Bright like koa but stronger midrange, grows warmer over time | Dark rich brown with striping |

### Top (Soundboard) Tonewoods

The top of the acoustic guitar is the first part to influence sound waves after plucking a string, playing a crucial role in shaping tone.

#### Spruce Varieties

| Spruce Type | Characteristics | Best For |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Sitka Spruce** | Baseline spruce, broad dynamic range, crisp articulate sound, few overtones | Versatile - aggressive and gentle playing |
| **Adirondack (Eastern Red) Spruce** | Heavier and stiffer than Sitka, more volume and complexity with good clarity | Aggressive playing style |
| **Engelmann Spruce** | Lighter and less stiff, less volume and projection | Delicate playing style |
| **European (Alpine) Spruce** | Quick response, bright trebles, warm bass, loud projection, very dynamic | High-end instruments, fingerstyle |
| **Lutz Spruce** | Hybrid of Sitka and white spruce, consistent quality | General purpose |

#### Other Top Woods

| Wood Type | Characteristics | Best For |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Western Red Cedar** | Darker sound, richer overtones, lower density | Fingerstyle playing |
| **Mahogany** | Woody warm tone, emphasized midrange, less harmonic complexity | Focused sound |
| **Koa** | Great mid-range projection, natural compression, desirable overtones | Ukuleles and guitars |

### Key Acoustic Properties

1. **Density**: Affects sustain and tone brightness
   - Higher density = more sustain, sharper/brighter tones
   - Lower density = softer tones, less sustain

2. **Stiffness**: Affects frequency response and projection
   - Stiffer woods = more volume, better projection
   - Less stiff = more responsive to light touch

3. **Damping**: Affects overtone complexity
   - Lower damping = richer overtones, more complex sound
   - Higher damping = cleaner, more focused sound


## Phase 2: Premium Tonewoods Deep Dive

### Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra)

**Scientific Name**: Dalbergia nigra  
**CITES Status**: Appendix I (most protected species, export banned since 1992)  
**Common Pairings**: Adirondack spruce tops

#### Acoustic Properties

Brazilian rosewood is considered the "Holy Grail" of tonewoods. Its exceptional properties include:

1. **Bass Response**: Genuine, tangible weight to the bass that sweeps and swells underneath every aspect of the instrument's tone, anchoring and embracing the music simultaneously.

2. **Overtone Complexity**: Bursts forth with a naturally reverb-laden cornucopia of overtones so rich and enduring that the sound is often described in terms reserved for fine wines.

3. **Sustain**: Mind-boggling tonal complexity with humming, eternal sustain.

4. **Balance**: Never outshines its topwood - walks alongside, bringing out its best attributes.

5. **Dynamic Range**: Under Adirondack spruce, the sheer, vibrant, cutting power is released, amplified and balanced. Every nuance is heard with bare fingers; dig in with a thick bluegrass pick and articulation explodes.

#### Tonal Characteristics

> — Bedell Guitars

Brazilian rosewood is described as having a "glass-like ring" that sustains, distinguishing it from East Indian rosewood which has a simpler tonal profile.


### Cocobolo (Dalbergia retusa)

**Scientific Name**: Dalbergia retusa  
**Origin**: Central Mexico, Central America  
**CITES Status**: Appendix II (regulated trade)

#### Acoustic Properties

Cocobolo is one of the world's densest tonewoods with exceptional acoustic characteristics:

1. **Density**: Specific gravity of 1.1 (negatively buoyant - sinks in water)
2. **Stiffness**: Very high, contributing to fast response
3. **Oil Content**: Exceptionally oily, which affects finishing and handling

#### Tonal Characteristics

## Phase 3: Microphone Techniques for Recording Acoustic Guitars

### Understanding Guitar Sound Dispersion

The acoustic guitar produces sound through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Panel Resonances**: Wooden panels (top, back, sides) vibrate in complex ways
2. **Air Resonance**: Body of air contained within the guitar (tuned around 100Hz)
3. **String Sound**: Direct sound from vibrating strings
4. **Mechanical Noises**: Picking and fretting sounds

### Key Principles

**Air Resonance Effects**:
- Tuned around 100Hz during manufacture
- Close mic on-axis with soundhole produces "booming" quality
- Moving mic away from soundhole reduces low-end power
- Moving toward fretboard emphasizes brighter, direct string sound

**Frequency Dispersion**:
- Body/air resonances carry further than string sounds
- High frequencies are more easily shadowed by obstructions
- Mic positions that can't "see" strings will be warmer and more subdued

### Single Microphone Positions

#### 1. "Vanilla Position" (Most Common)
- **Location**: Pointing at junction between neck and body (12th fret area)
- **Character**: Good balance of body resonance and string liveliness
- **Best For**: Acoustic guitar in busy mixes
- **Distance**: 6-12 inches typically

#### 2. Front Body Position (Albini/Schmitt/Scott Method)
- **Location**: Front of guitar body, horizontally in line with soundhole
- **Angle**: Off-axis vertically to avoid air resonance boom
- **Character**: More body resonance, less string emphasis
- **Best For**: Full, natural guitar sound

#### 3. Bridge Arc Position
- **Location**: Arc around the bridge, pointing toward it
- **Character**: Less bright string sound, more panel resonance
- **Best For**: Reducing fret noise (fingerpicking)

#### 4. Over-the-Shoulder Position
- **Location**: Near player's ear, slightly forward of head
- **Character**: Captures what the player hears
- **Caution**: Watch for high-frequency shadowing

### Stereo Microphone Techniques

#### X/Y (Coincident Pair)
- Two small diaphragm condensers with capsules nearly touching
- One mic angled 45° up, other 45° down
- **Pros**: Mono-compatible, no phase issues
- **Cons**: Less dramatic stereo image

#### Spaced Pair (A/B)
- Two mics separated by 12-24 inches
- Common setup: One at 12th fret, one at bridge
- **Pros**: Wide stereo image, captures full frequency range
- **Cons**: Potential phase issues, less mono-compatible

#### Mid-Side (M/S)
- Cardioid mic (mid) + figure-8 mic (side)
- Adjustable stereo width in post-production
- **Pros**: Perfect mono compatibility, flexible
- **Cons**: Requires decoding, more complex setup

#### ORTF
- Two cardioid mics, 17cm apart, angled 110° apart
- **Pros**: Natural stereo image, good mono compatibility
- **Cons**: Requires matched pair

| Microphone | Character | Price Range |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Shure SM57** | Punchy, handles high SPL | Budget |
| **Sennheiser MD 421** | Full-bodied, warm | Professional |

### Distance and Room Considerations

**Close Miking (3-8 inches)**:
- More direct sound, less room ambience
- Greater string detail and pick noise
- Proximity effect with cardioid mics (bass boost)

**Medium Distance (12-24 inches)**:
- Better balance of instrument components
- Some room ambience
- More natural, cohesive sound

**Far Miking (2-3 feet)**:
- Natural projection of instrument
- Significant room contribution
- Requires good acoustic environment

### Professional Tips

1. **Pre-Mic Listening**: Move your head around the guitar to find the best sound before placing mic (Mike Clink technique)

2. **Headphone Monitoring**: Spend 3 minutes with headphones, moving mic until it sounds right (Pierre Marchand technique)

3. **Pick Selection**: Experiment with soft, medium, and heavy picks - significantly affects tone

4. **String Age**: Fresh strings for brightness, older strings for warmth

5. **Room Treatment**: Dead room for isolation, live room for natural ambience
